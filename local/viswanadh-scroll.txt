Well... I was thinking, on how lucky I am that our paths crossed when they did. I am really Grateful that we are Bestfriends. Of course I know what today is, buddy. Don't tell me you forgot the process. You're supposed to make a wish on your birthday first. ...You have too many wishes? It's your birthday. There's no harm in being a little greedy. It's also pointless to worry about them coming true. I hope your future is filled with everything you like.


I hope this year brings you all the success you’re working toward, both in your badminton and in everything else you’re passionate about. Every Birthday is the symbol of the fresh start. May your Birtday also begin for you a new phase of life, Where each day presents you a new phase of life, where each day presents you a world of new opportunities and opens up doors to a promising future. Well, I definetly couldn't get you physical gift. But I definetly can make up a website... Yeah I know, I know, Maybe little cringe, 😅. Hehe, but bear this... Oh yeah I forgot... Sorry but not sorry... I stalked you a little to find a photo hehe. I PROMISE I AM NOT A CREEP. Weird. I am writing whatever shit comes in my mind... Whatever, haha.
